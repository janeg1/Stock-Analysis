# Stock-analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project
We are given a Data, that represents Green Energy stocks available on the Stock Market to buy and its performance over 2017/2018. Client (Steve) needs to help his parents to decide how to diversify their portfoli0, as they are interested in investing in Green Energy sector. 

### Purpose
 By sorting data provided, we are going to create a data that shows the total volume of shares for each stock traded during 2017 and 2018, and the return in percent for each year. We also will color code it for better visual reading and to give an overall idea of stock performance. Based on this data client will determine how to diversify their portfolio in the future. We will create a macro in VBA program to run 2018 data, and then we will refactor this code to see if we can get same results faster.

## Results
When we ran our original code for 2018, it took 0.4804688 seconds. Refactored code took 0.2890625. So almost twice as fast.

## Summary

### What are advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages: code is easier to read, and it runs faster. Disadventages: can be time consuming, can create errors or bugs.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA Scrips.
As I donâ€™t have much experience with coding, obvious disadvantage for me was the time it took to refactor the code, even though I just created a previous one. obvious advantage was the time it took to run database through. it was almost half the time of original code.

P.S. i was not sure which method to use to include images with timers, also was not clear on if i should include image of macros, even thogh they are available in the work book.
